vivganes: Give me a mermaid file in folder `1-architecture/Diagrams/` depicting Entity Relationship Diagram for all entities present in `1-architecture/Entities` directory.

Include a relevant `title` in the front-matter.

Place the mermaid code without backticks in the file directly.

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///d%3A/source-codes/test-first-copilot/04-fix-entities-and-generate-erd/1-architecture/Diagrams/entity-relationship.mmd)

The Mermaid file `entity-relationship.mmd` has been created in the `1-architecture/Diagrams/` folder. It contains an Entity Relationship Diagram for all entities present in the `1-architecture/Entities` directory, with a relevant title in the front-matter and the Mermaid code placed directly in the file.

Made changes.
