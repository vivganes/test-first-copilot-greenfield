vivganes: Create a mermaid file in `2-design/Diagrams/angular-portal/Sequence` folder with the sequence diagram for the user registration UI.

This needs to be as per Angular conventions.

The classes  involved are outlined in `2-design/angular-portal/Components` folder.

Include a relevant `title` in the front-matter.

Place the mermaid code without backticks in the file directly.
