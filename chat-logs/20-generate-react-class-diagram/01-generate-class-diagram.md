Create a mermaid file `2-design/Diagrams/react-portal/Class/user-registration-class-diagram.mmd` with the Class diagram depicting all the components involved (and their inter-relationships) in the user registration UI.  Include a relevant `title` in the front-matter.

Place the mermaid code without backticks in the file directly.

The already brainstormed list of components and their details is present in `2-design/react-portal/Components` folder.

OpenAPI spec for the backend API is at `2-design/API/user-registration-openapi.yaml`.
