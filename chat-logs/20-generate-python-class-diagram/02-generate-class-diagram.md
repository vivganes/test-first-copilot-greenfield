vivganes: Create a mermaid file `2-design/Diagrams/python-user-service/Class/user-registration-class-diagram.mmd` with the Class diagram depicting all the classes involved (and their inter-relationships) in the user registration API.  Include a relevant `title` in the front-matter.

Place the mermaid code without backticks in the file directly.

The already brainstormed list of classes and their details is present in `2-design/python-user-service/Classes` folder.

OpenAPI spec for the API is at `2-design/API/user-registration-openapi.yaml`.

The Mermaid class diagram for the user registration API has been created at `2-design/Diagrams/python-user-service/Class/user-registration-class-diagram.mmd`. It includes all relevant classes and their relationships, with a clear title in the front-matter.

Let me know if you want to preview or further refine the diagram.
